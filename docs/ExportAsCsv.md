# Export as CSV

Hereâ€™s a sequence diagram for the process of exporting scan results as a CSV file. This involves the user requesting the CSV export, the frontend communicating with the backend to process this request, and then the backend fetching the data and returning it in CSV format.

    User->>+Frontend: Request CSV export
    Frontend->>+Backend: Request export with parameters (e.g., filter, range)
    Backend->>+Database: Query for results based on provided parameters
    Database-->>-Backend: Return query results
    Backend->>+Backend: Format data as CSV
    Backend-->>-Frontend: Send CSV file
    Frontend->>+User: Provide download link/button for CSV file

```

This sequence diagram provides a clear visualization of the steps involved in exporting data as a CSV file, from user request through data formatting and delivery. This functionality is especially useful in applications where data portability and offline data analysis are important features.
